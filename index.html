        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;"> The Lore Of The Pinewood Orphanage</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">[the timeline is set in the 1990 with the children being around the age 8-13]</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;"><i> deep in the forest, amidst the pine trees, was an orphanage. a small community living a solitude life under one roof. 
Though, their fate turned upside down after one dreadful night.</i></p>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;"> <i>The Pinewood Orphanage is a small community or "family" settled in the far land of the pinewood forest. Mother rosary, the sole caretaker of the children, 
is a strict, yet a gentle mother figure. Mother rosary raises the children like her own, despite not being blood related. The children of the Pinewood house have barely seen the world outside. The thick pine forest around their house is like a nature border. Even since newborn, all they've known were Mother rosary, the house, the pine trees and eachother. </i></p>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><i> One particular night, a child goes missing. everyone was frantic. except for her, mother rosary. she showed deep concern at first,
but turned indifferent a bit too quickly. Later on, as the situation grow worse, she turned even more colder, as if the children survival isn't a concern at all.</i></p>
<p style="font-size: 25px;"><i>Night after night, more children goes missing. Until one afternoon, a body was found dead, rotting within the bushes. Mother rosary has acted as if she was blind, but the children weren't dumb 
neither. they have take matter to their own hand before more innocent lives were killed. it couldn't be mother rosary herself, she was out of the house one night,
and yet, the massacre keeps on going. it must be one of them, something is mimicking to be an innocent child. Lurking amongst them for the next victim. <b>They must eliminate the mimic before more innocent lives get taken.</b> Only then could they flee from the house for good.</i> </p>
